<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Space Speeder is a 3D game that started out as a game called 'Cubetacular' that I made in Unity while following along to a Brackeys youtube tutorial.
Space Speeder has become my own personal twist on the tutorial. Overtime I will continue to update this adding different features, materials, levels, and features. Join me on the journey!

Though Space Speeder is still being created, feel free to play the Windows desktop version of Cubetacular! To do so, download the Windows64 zip file.
