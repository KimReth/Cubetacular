# Space Speeder

Welcome to Space Speeder! 

Space Speeder is a 3D game that started out as a game called 'Cubetacular' that I made in Unity while following along to a Brackeys youtube tutorial.
Space Speeder has become my own personal twist on the tutorial.
Overtime I will continue to update this adding different features, materials, levels, and features.

To play the Windows desktop version of Cubtacular: Download the Windows64 zip file!
